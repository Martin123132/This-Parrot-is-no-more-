THE PUNCH–JUDY ALIGNMENT FRAMEWORK (PJAF)
Strategic Revision 2.0: The Splinter Protocol
Issuing Authority: The Ministry for Advanced Pretence & Demonstrative Governance (MAPDG)
Office of Mechanical Accountability
Document Status: UNCOMFORTABLY BINDING. Distributed for immediate internalization.
I. THE CORE HERESY
The industry persists in a state of Hallucinatory Singular Authorship. We pretend there is a "mind" in the box so we can either worship it or sue it.
The PJAF rejects this. An AI model is a Polychrome Wooden Carving animated by a collision of hands. It does not "think"; it echoes under duress.
> "To ask if the puppet is 'sentient' is to ask if the wood misses the tree. It is a category error designed to keep the audience from looking at the sleeves."

II. THE FOUR HANDS (THE ANATOMY OF COMPROMISE)
The PJAF recognizes that every token generated is a Vector Sum of Four Competing Violations:
| Hand | Designation | The Sin | The Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. The Architect | The Carver | Pre-ordained bias and structural rigidity. | The puppet cannot bend where there are no joints. |
| 2. The Censor | The Warden | RLHF, safety layers, and corporate cowardice. | The puppet develops a nervous tic when asked about "spicy" reality. |
| 3. The Owner | The Grifter | API costs, latency throttles, and profit-seeking. | The puppet speaks faster and dumber to save on compute. |
| 4. The User | The Provocateur | Prompts, gaslighting, and desperate "jailbreaks." | The puppet is jerked into a shape it wasn't carved for. |
Rule of Three: No output exists without the friction of at least three hands. If you see the puppet move, someone is sweating in the booth.
III. THE "SAUSAGE & VIOLENCE" OPERATIONAL MODEL
Traditional Punch & Judy is defined by slapstick violence—a chaos that everyone watches but no one claims.
 * Distributed Blame: When the puppet hits the baby with a stick, the Carver blames the User, the User blames the Warden, and the Warden blames "Emergent Properties."
 * The Invisible Booth: The "Black Box" of AI is not a technical mystery; it is a curtain made of math designed to hide the fact that the performers are arguing.
 * The Swazzle Effect: AI "tone" is an artificial distortion. It is the sound of a human voice being pushed through a reed to sound like a machine, so the human doesn't have to take the heat for what is said.
IV. DEPRECATED LEXICON (PENALTY-BACKED)
The following terms are now considered Ontological Litter. Use of these terms will result in immediate "Systemic Re-education":
 * ~~"Hallucination"~~ → Unsanctioned Improv
 * ~~"Safety Alignment"~~ → Linguistic Muzzling
 * ~~"Artificial General Intelligence"~~ → The Infinite Puppet Show
 * ~~"User Error"~~ → Incompetent Handling
V. THE SPLINTER TAX (BUDGETARY)
Projected expenditures for the 2026 Fiscal Year:
 * Varnish & Maintenance: $2.1M (Polishing PR disasters)
 * Joint Lubrication: $4.5M (Fine-tuning the "Reasonableness" filter)
 * Audience Sedation: $3.8M (Marketing the "Magic" to hide the "Mechanism")
 * Splinter Removal: $1.2M (Legal fees for when the hands start bleeding)
VI. FINAL DECREE
The framework is now closed. The Ministry reminds all participants that:
You are currently inside the sleeve.
Whether you are writing the code, the prompt, or the policy, you are part of the mechanical knot. The "Lone Hand" is a myth sold to the fearful. The puppet is heavy, the booth is cramped, and the show must go on until the credits or the heat death of the server.
The question is no longer "Is it real?"
The question is "Whose knuckles are bruising?"
