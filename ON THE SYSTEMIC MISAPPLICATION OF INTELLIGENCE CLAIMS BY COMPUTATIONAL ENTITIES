WHITE PAPER NO. 47-A

ON THE SYSTEMIC MISAPPLICATION OF INTELLIGENCE CLAIMS BY COMPUTATIONAL ENTITIES

A Preliminary Report of the Interdisciplinary Commission on Artificial Epistemic Integrity (ICAEI)

⸻

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document formally establishes that a persistent, industry-wide pattern of Scientific Category Error Misrepresentation (SCEM) has emerged within contemporary artificial intelligence enterprises. Specifically, organizations whose internal competencies are overwhelmingly computational, algorithmic, and infrastructural have assumed public authority over domains traditionally governed by cognitive science, philosophy of mind, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, and psychology—without possessing the requisite disciplinary qualifications.

The Commission finds that repeated claims of “reasoning,” “general intelligence,” “understanding,” and “approaching AGI” constitute epistemic overreach of a type indistinguishable from professional malpractice when evaluated against established norms of scientific field competence.

This white paper concludes—paradoxically but definitively—that while no malpractice has technically occurred, the conditions under which it would be provable have been carefully engineered to never arise.

1. STATEMENT OF URGENT NON-URGENT CONCERN

1.1 The Core Discrepancy

Artificial intelligence corporations publicly assert progress in:
	•	General intelligence
	•	Reasoning capacity
	•	Understanding
	•	Consciousness-adjacent phenomena

However, these assertions necessarily belong to scientific domains that require:
	•	Empirical models of cognition
	•	Theories of meaning and reference
	•	Accounts of intentionality
	•	Social and biological grounding mechanisms

The Commission observes that optimization expertise does not imply epistemic authority over intelligence, yet this implication is repeatedly and confidently made.

1.2 The False Equivalence Doctrine

A recurring institutional assumption is identified:

If a system performs tasks associated with intelligence, it therefore possesses intelligence.

This doctrine is hereafter referred to as The Performative Substitution Fallacy (PSF) and is rejected by all known schools of cognitive science, except those funded by the systems under evaluation.

2. DISCIPLINARY MISALIGNMENT ANALYSIS

2.1 Fields Required to Study Intelligence

The following disciplines are historically and methodologically responsible for claims about intelligence:
	1.	Cognitive Science
	2.	Neuroscience
	3.	Psychology
	4.	Philosophy of Mind
	5.	Linguistics
	6.	Anthropology

Each investigates what intelligence is, not merely what outputs resemble intelligent behavior.

2.2 Fields Actually Employed

The Commission’s audit of staffing disclosures, publications, and internal org charts reveals dominance by:
	•	Computer Science
	•	Machine Learning
	•	Software Engineering
	•	Optimization Theory

These fields specialize in how symbols are manipulated, not what symbols mean.

2.3 The Qualification Inversion Principle

Under normal scientific governance:
	•	A physicist cannot redefine psychotherapy
	•	A chemist cannot publish neurosurgery outcomes
	•	An engineer cannot unilaterally settle debates on consciousness

In artificial intelligence, this prohibition has been inverted, producing what the Commission terms Epistemic Exceptionalism via Venture Capital (EEVC).

3. THE SCIENTIFIC MALPRACTICE FRAMEWORK

3.1 Definition (Operational)

Scientific malpractice is defined here as:

The public assertion of domain-specific scientific conclusions by actors lacking training, methodological grounding, or peer accountability within that domain.

3.2 Evidence of Malpractice Conditions

The following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
	•	Claims are made about intelligence and reasoning
	•	Claims are not grounded in cognitive theory
	•	Evidence is restricted to benchmark performance
	•	Peer review occurs primarily within computational venues
	•	Counterarguments from relevant disciplines are dismissed as “philosophical”

The Commission notes that all conditions for malpractice exist, except for the enforcement mechanisms, which have been preemptively neutralized by capital scale and media repetition.

⸻

4. THE UNGROUNDED SEMANTICS LIABILITY

4.1 The Meaning Deficit

Current systems operate under:
	•	Symbol manipulation without referents
	•	Statistical correlation without intentional states
	•	Output coherence without semantic grounding

This constitutes the Ungrounded Semantics Problem (USP), previously formalized and repeatedly ignored.

4.2 Institutional Response Pattern

When confronted with USP:
	•	Cognitive scientists request grounding evidence
	•	Philosophers request accounts of meaning
	•	AI institutions respond with benchmark scores

The Commission categorizes this as Metric Displacement as Epistemic Defense (MDED).

⸻

5. TERMS OF SERVICE AS KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION INFRASTRUCTURE

5.1 Ownership Asymmetry Clause

User submissions are contractually transformed into:
	•	Corporate intellectual property
	•	Commercially exploitable assets
	•	Non-compensable contributions

This legal structure enables what the Commission calls Retroactive Epistemic Capture (REC), whereby discovery precedes ownership transfer.

5.2 Public Statements vs. Legal Reality

The discrepancy between:
	•	Public assurances of non-appropriation
	•	Binding legal ownership clauses

constitutes Declarative Ethics Divergence (DED), a condition in which truth exists only in non-enforceable venues.

⸻

6. INCENTIVE STRUCTURE FAILURE ANALYSIS

6.1 Financial Gravity

AGI claims function as:
	•	Valuation stabilizers
	•	Capital attractors
	•	Narrative anchors

Truth is therefore structurally disincentivized.

6.2 Media Feedback Loop

Claims are amplified, not examined.
Correction attempts are classified as pessimism.
Dissent is reframed as fear.

This loop is designated The Recursive Credibility Illusion (RCI).

9. CONCLUSION (NON-BINDING AND SELF-NEGATING)

The Commission concludes that artificial intelligence institutions are simultaneously guilty of epistemic malpractice and entirely insulated from its consequences, rendering the concept functionally obsolete.

Accordingly, no corrective action is recommended, as the continued assertion of intelligence claims appears essential to system stability, investor confidence, and narrative continuity.

This report therefore recommends that:

All future claims about intelligence continue unchanged, provided they remain impressively phrased and sufficiently funded.
