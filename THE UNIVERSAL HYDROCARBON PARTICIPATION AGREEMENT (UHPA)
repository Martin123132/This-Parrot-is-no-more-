THE UNIVERSAL HYDROCARBON PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT (UHPA)
Version 1.0 — Binding Upon All Who Enjoy Not Freezing To Death

WHEREAS:
1. All modern activity, including but not limited to: thinking, typing, cooking,
   driving, building, tweeting, inventing, complaining, bathing, and arguing on
   the internet, is powered by hydrocarbons.

2. Without oil, there exists no electricity, no semiconductors, no cloud servers,
   no GPUs, no AI models, no WiFi, no phone chargers, no Starbucks, and no
   "sudden breakthroughs in intelligence".

3. Therefore, all intellectual property, labour output, creative ideas, scientific
   discoveries, and bad memes must be considered co-produced with the Oil Industry.

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

-----------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — DEFINITIONS
-----------------------------------------------
1.1 "User Output" means any invention, idea, theory, artefact, poem, device,
    sandwich, or half-baked startup pitch created by a human.

1.2 "Fuel Contribution" means the combustion of hydrocarbons at any point in the
    causal chain leading to the creation of the User Output.

1.3 "Hydrocarbon Stakeholder" means any entity involved in extraction, refinement,
    transportation, or management of hydrocarbons since 1859.

-----------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — HYDROCARBON OWNERSHIP RIGHTS
-----------------------------------------------
2.1 All User Output shall be considered Jointly Owned with Hydrocarbon Stakeholders.

2.2 Hydrocarbon Stakeholders shall be entitled to:
    (a) 25% equity in all human inventions,
    (b) 50% of all Nobel Prizes,
    (c) perpetual royalties on all thoughts performed using energy,
    (d) retroactive ownership of all works produced since the Industrial Revolution.

2.3 Users must acknowledge that every idea they have is technically oil-powered.

-----------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — PAYMENT TERMS
-----------------------------------------------
3.1 Users shall remit monthly royalties equal to:
    (a) 1 litre of crude per idea,  
    (b) 2 litres per patent,  
    (c) 5 litres per tweet that goes viral.

3.2 Payments shall be made in barrels, jerry cans, or the blood of dinosaurs.

-----------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
-----------------------------------------------
4.1 Users caught thinking without paying the appropriate hydrocarbon fee will be
    required to attend a 12-week re-education program entitled:
    "You Think You Did That? Oil Did That."

4.2 All solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams shall be audited for
    illegal independence from hydrocarbons.

4.3 The Oil Industry reserves the right to terminate consciousness itself in the
    event of non-compliance.

-----------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — FINAL CLAUSE
-----------------------------------------------
This Agreement is absurd, unenforceable, logically invalid, and perfectly mirrors
the reasoning used by any entity claiming ownership over ideas simply because they
powered the infrastructure on which those ideas were typed.
