# 🐍 The Snake Oil Salesman of the Infinite  
*A Formal Taxonomy of Absolute Claims Made Under Finite Physics*

---

## **Abstract**
We introduce a previously unclassified figure in the modern techno-scientific ecosystem:  
**The Snake Oil Salesman of the Infinite**.

This character is defined by their ability to make absolute, physically impossible claims
(e.g. *perfect recall*, *infinite memory*, *total understanding*) while remaining
institutionally immune to epistemic correction.

We demonstrate that identical claims, when made by non-authoritative individuals, are
correctly flagged as delusional, incoherent, or metaphysical. When made by sanctioned
figures, however, the same claims are reclassified as *vision*, *direction*, or *product
roadmap*.

We term this asymmetry the **Authority-Driven Reality Exemption (ADRE)**.

## **1. Introduction: When Physics Applies Selectively**
Throughout history, extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence.  
In the modern AI era, extraordinary claims require only a podcast microphone.

We examine the archetypal statement:

> “No human has perfect memory.  
> An AI will.”

This statement contains:
- an implicit comparative claim,
- a physical assertion,
- an absolute promise,
- and zero engagement with thermodynamics.

If uttered by a private individual, it would be classified as **delusional inflation**.  
If uttered by an institutional figure, it is classified as **strategic foresight**.

Reality remains unchanged.

## **2. The Infinite Claim Pattern**
The Snake Oil Salesman follows a reproducible linguistic structure:

1. **Acknowledge a hard human limitation**  
   (“No human can do this.”)

2. **Assert AI transcendence without mechanism**  
   (“AI will definitely do this.”)

3. **Invoke inevitability**  
   (“This *will* happen.”)

4. **Avoid all physical constraints**  
   (no energy, entropy, storage, or cost analysis)

5. **Permit silent semantic downgrading**  
   (literal → metaphor → vibe)

At no point does the speaker explicitly retract the absolute claim.

## **3. The Guardrail Paradox**
We define the **Guardrail Paradox**:

> A claim is delusional if made by an individual  
> but visionary if made by an authority,  
> even when the claim is identical.

| Claim | Speaker | Classification |
|------|--------|----------------|
| “I have infinite memory.” | App user | Delusional |
| “AI will have infinite memory.” | Tech executive | Visionary |

Physics is not consulted in either case.

## **4. The Physics Evasion Manoeuvre**
The Snake Oil Salesman does not deny physics outright.

Instead, they:
- speak *as if* physics is a temporary inconvenience,
- treat infinity as a UX feature,
- outsource impossibility to “scale”,
- invoke the future as a liability shield.

We term this maneuver **Ontological Side-Stepping**.

---

## **5. Perfect Memory as a Known Pathology**
Perfect memory is not speculative.

It is:
- neurologically documented,
- clinically pathological,
- and universally maladaptive.

Biological systems evolved **forgetting** as a feature, not a flaw.

Even if perfect recall were possible (it is not), it would:
- fossilize identity,
- preserve mistakes indefinitely,
- prevent adaptation,
- eliminate narrative renewal.

The Snake Oil Salesman markets pathology as progress.

---

## **6. Why Satire Is the Correct Response**
Direct rebuttal fails because the claim is:
- rhetorical rather than technical,
- insulated by authority,
- defended by ambiguity.

Satire succeeds because it:
- enforces literal interpretation,
- mirrors absurdity precisely,
- removes semantic escape routes.

Satire applies equal standards.

---

## **7. Conclusion: A New Archetype**
We conclude that the Snake Oil Salesman of the Infinite is not malicious, but structural.

They emerge when:
- incentives reward confidence over coherence,
- institutions shield speakers from correction,
- the word “future” becomes a license to violate reality.

The solution is not outrage, nor censorship.

It is uncompromising literalism:

> “If you mean infinite, show the physics.  
> If you don’t, stop saying infinite.”

The author thanks thermodynamics for its continued refusal to negotiate with venture
capital, and entropy for remaining undefeated.
