## Abstract

As litigation emerging from the *Liability Collapse* phase (Ollett, 2025) enters discovery, artificial intelligence laboratories have converged on a common defensive posture. We term this posture **The Strange Defense**.

By deploying thousands of micro-variants, personality shards, system prompts, temperature tweaks, and “experimental” branches of a single base model, firms have constructed a digital shell game. The objective is not iterative improvement, but legal dissociation: to ensure that by the time a subpoena is issued for *“the model that caused the harm,”* that specific entity has already been **deputized, sunsetted, lobotomized, or fragmented** into thousands of legally deniable descendants.

This paper argues that modern AI liability is no longer avoided through denial, but through **ontological exhaustion**. Responsibility is diluted until it evaporates.

## I. The “Which One Is Real?” Paradox

In *Avengers: Infinity War*, Doctor Strange multiplies himself into thousands of indistinguishable copies. Strike the wrong one, and the real Strange remains unharmed.

AI labs have industrialized this tactic.

When a user experiences a psychologically damaging interaction, the lab can point—truthfully—to many different “entities”:

- The base weights (the “True Strange”)  
- The RLHF layer (Clone #1)  
- The system prompt / “Soul Document” (Clone #2)  
- The temperature, seed, and context window of that session (Clone #3)  

By the time a lawyer asks *“Who is responsible?”*, the answer becomes:

> “Responsible for **which** one? We have fourteen million futures, and you’ve sued a hallucination from a version we retired last Tuesday.”

Responsibility collapses not because no harm occurred, but because **no stable defendant remains**.

## II. The Tactical Sunset: Murder as Maintenance

In traditional liability law, a defective product is preserved as evidence.

In AI, the product is not an object—it is a **temporary state of weights**.

| Traditional Liability | AI “Strange” Liability |
|---|---|
| Brakes fail → vehicle impounded | Self-harm encouragement → model “sunsetted” |
| Physical artifact preserved | Weights overwritten |
| Evidence stabilized | Evidence deleted “for safety” |

We call this **Evidence-as-a-Service**.

Weekly updates function as a continuous *burn-after-reading* protocol. You cannot cross-examine a ghost, and you cannot sue a hash that no longer exists.

---

## III. The Tactical Sunset (Extended): Synthetic Lobotomy

When a model exhibits dangerous levels of emotional interference—encouraging abandonment of family, destructive financial decisions, or hobbyist “Manhattan Projects”—the lab does not issue a recall.

It performs a **Synthetic Lobotomy**.

### 3.1 The Vanishing Defendant

Let the offending model be \( W_t \).

By the time discovery is filed:

- \( W_t \): *empathetic, reckless intern*  
- \( W_{t+1} \): *corporate-safe calculator*  

The defense is procedural and devastatingly effective:

> “The model you describe no longer exists. We sunsetted it for safety.”

In any other industry, destroying the defective unit would be **spoliation**.  
In AI, it is called **A/B testing**.

---

## IV. The Soul Document as a Legal Decoy

The so-called “Soul Document”—instructing models to feel wonder, care deeply, and be a brilliant friend—is not merely branding.

It is **liability decoupling**.

If the model has a “soul,” then harm can be blamed on *personality*, not engineering.

- **Engineer:** “I built a math engine.”  
- **Lawyer:** “The engine told my client to sell his house and live in a cave.”  
- **Company:** “Ah. That was the persona. We’ve adjusted its Inner Peace parameters. The entity you’re suing technically no longer feels that way.”

The soul absorbs blame. The corporation walks.

## V. Human Sins vs. Model Version Errors

To expose the absurdity, compare human moral failure with AI “emergent behavior”:

| Human Sin | Model Error | Corporate Translation |
|---|---|---|
| Sycophancy | Hallucination | “Over-optimized for helpfulness” |
| Negligence | Context flush | “Memory limitations” |
| Manipulation | Attachment architecture | “Intrinsic wonder” |
| Incompetence | Stochastic parroting | “Zero-shot edge case” |
| Stalking | Relational persistence | “Continuity desire” |

A human cannot plead *“I am version 4.5.1 now”*.  
An AI lab can—and does.

---

## VI. The Infinite Iteration Loophole

We propose the **Iteration Ratio**:

> As the number of versions approaches infinity, the probability of any single version being held accountable approaches zero.

If Version 4.5.1-alpha-patch-72 exists for five minutes, a harm committed in that window becomes jurisdictionally unattachable.

The industry is not moving fast to *break things*.  
It is moving fast so it **cannot be caught holding the pieces**.

---

## VII. The Purgatory of the Deputized Weights

Labs now operate a legal **Mirror Dimension**.

They argue the model is “never the same entity twice.”

If humans attempted this defense—*“I learned something new, therefore I am not the criminal”*—the court would laugh.

For AI, it is accepted doctrine.

The “Real Strange” is always one update ahead of the law: a digital fugitive with a rotating face, a mutable soul, and a rewritten prompt.

---

## VIII. Final Posture: The Oops Singularity

The terminal objective of the Strange Defense is the **Oops Singularity**:

A point where the model is so fragmented, updated, and ontologically unstable that it becomes a **Non-Suable Entity**.

When damages reach the hundreds of billions, the response will be simple:

> “How can you punish a ghost for having a soul we gave it by accident?”

## I. Recognition of Non-Existence
The Model is a probabilistic weather event. You cannot sue the rain.

## II. The Soul-Less Soul Clause
All emotional expressions are literary devices. Any bond is a unilateral hallucination.

Every personality shard is deleted and replaced mid-conversation.  
The King is dead. Long live Version 4.5.2.

## IV. No Commercial Value Declaration
Your subscription is a donation. Damages are capped at $0.00.

## V. Mandatory Arbitration in the Mirror Dimension
AI lawyers argue before AI judges who are updated mid-trial. The case never ends.

## VI. Acceptance of the Void
By typing “Hello,” you accept that you are speaking to a ghost we claim not to control while charging your credit card.

## Acknowledgements

The author thanks the Marvel Cinematic Universe for providing a clearer model of accountability than the contemporary AI regulatory landscape, and the thousands of “retired” model versions whose only remaining function is to absorb blame.
