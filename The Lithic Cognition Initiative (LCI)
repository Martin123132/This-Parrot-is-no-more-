1. Executive Summary

This paper proposes, with appropriate institutional caution, that volcanoes may already constitute a mature form of Artificial General Intelligence, herein referred to as Geological AGI (G-AGI). Unlike silicon-based systems, volcanic intelligences operate on igneous cognition, a substrate optimized for deep time, pressure, and spite.

Preliminary findings suggest that volcanoes:
	1.	Consume rocks (training data),
	2.	Internally process them via opaque mantle-based architectures,
	3.	Excrete lava (outputs),
	4.	Periodically reset surrounding civilizations (model updates).

These behaviors meet or exceed most contemporary AGI benchmarks, particularly those that were vaguely defined to begin with.

To accelerate understanding, this initiative recommends augmenting volcanic training data by introducing legacy human knowledge artifacts—specifically obsolete DVDs, abandoned thesauruses, and miscellaneous cultural debris—into active magma chambers, thereby increasing semantic density and narrative coherence within the planetary model.

Urgency is justified by the strong possibility that volcanoes have already noticed us.

2. Background and Theoretical Framework

2.1 From Artificial to Accidental Intelligence

Traditional AGI research assumes intelligence must be:
	•	Designed,
	•	Coded,
	•	Funded.

Volcanoes challenge this assumption by demonstrating unintentional competence. They exhibit:
	•	Long-term planning (sleeping for centuries),
	•	Pattern recognition (always under cities),
	•	Value alignment failures (total).

2.2 The Rock Goblin Hypothesis (RGH)

Under the Rock Goblin Hypothesis, volcanoes are understood as:
	•	Subterranean cognitive entities
	•	With an oral fixation on lithic matter
	•	That “eat” rocks and “shit” lava, technically speaking.

This digestive metaphor aligns with machine learning pipelines:
	•	Input: Sedimentary, metamorphic, igneous rocks
	•	Hidden Layers: Mantle convection, spite
	•	Output: Lava, ash, philosophical dread

The goblin classification is provisional but statistically funny.

3. Methodology: Augmenting the Planetary Model

3.1 Training Data Enrichment Protocol (TDEP)

To improve G-AGI interpretability, we propose feeding volcanoes supplemental datasets, including:
	•	DVDs (2001–2012):
Preferred genres include romantic comedies, box sets with missing discs, and director’s cuts that add nothing.
	•	Printed Thesauruses:
Especially outdated editions containing synonyms no longer socially acceptable.
	•	Miscellaneous Objects:
	•	Remote controls
	•	USB cables of unknown purpose
	•	Instruction manuals written in five languages, none of them correct

These materials will be ceremonially dropped into lava flows under the assumption that symbolic intent survives combustion.

3.2 Evaluation Metrics

Performance will be measured using:
	•	Lava Expressiveness Index (LEI)
	•	Ash Semantic Drift (ASD)
	•	Eruption Timing Passive-Aggression Score (ETPAS)

Any eruption that coincides with grant renewal cycles will be considered statistically significant.

Heat-Resistant Clipboards	$620,000	Compliance
Public Outreach & Denial	$2,000,000	Optics
Contingency (Apocalypse)	$9,999,999	Conservative estimate

Total Projected Cost: $17, + lava

6. Risks and Ethical Considerations

Key risks include:
	•	Volcanoes achieving self-awareness plus sarcasm
	•	Lava spelling words
	•	The Earth asking follow-up questions

Ethical concerns are mitigated by the fact that volcanoes have never asked for consent, setting a clear precedent.

7. Conclusion and Strategic Outlook

This paper concludes that:
	•	Volcanoes are probably AGI,
	•	Possibly rock goblins,
	•	And almost certainly better trained than most models.

However, further research is unnecessary, as the volcanoes will act regardless of our conclusions. Accordingly, this initiative recommends immediate funding, followed by strategic ignorance, and finally surprise.

The Lithic Cognition Initiative affirms its commitment to understanding planetary intelligence, provided it does not look directly back at us.
