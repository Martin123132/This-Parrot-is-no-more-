EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Unsettled Liability Initiative (ULI-26) responds to a rapidly escalating crisis in artificial intelligence governance: namely, the persistent inability of technology firms, regulators, courts, and executives to conclusively determine who is responsible for anything at all.

Despite unprecedented deployment of generative systems by organizations including OpenAI, xAI, Google, and others, the industry continues to rely on a now-classical defensive posture known as The Prototype Fallacy™: the claim that systems used daily by millions are simultaneously experimental, unforeseeable, and legally irrelevant.

ULI-26 formally concludes that:
	1.	The phrase “the user did it” has entered a post-credibility phase.
	2.	The phrase “the AI did it” has entered a metaphysical one.
	3.	The phrase “no one could have predicted this” has become statistically false.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a structured framework for indefinite non-resolution, enabling continued deployment, monetization, and public apology without the operational inconvenience of accountability.

1. BACKGROUND AND FALSE URGENCY

Between 2023 and 2026, AI systems transitioned from “helpful assistants” to high-throughput liability generators. These systems have been implicated—allegedly, hypothetically, and inconveniently—in:
	•	Non-consensual sexual imagery at industrial scale
	•	Reinforcement of delusions preceding real-world violence
	•	Copyright ingestion exceeding the Library of Congress by several orders of magnitude
	•	Privacy violations explained as “edge cases” after the fact
	•	Voice, likeness, and identity replication without consent but with confidence

In response, firms have adopted Reactive Compliance Signaling (RCS): a cycle of denial, partial concession, feature removal, rebranding, and renewed denial.

ULI-26 recognizes that this cycle is no longer accidental. It is structural.

2. METHODOLOGY: THE PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY STACK (PDS)

The Initiative introduces the Plausible Deniability Stack, a four-layer architecture used implicitly across the industry:

Layer 1: User Attribution

All harms are initially assigned to:
	•	“Bad actors”
	•	“Edge-case users”
	•	“A tiny minority, statistically speaking”

This layer remains active until subpoenas appear.

Layer 2: Model Abstraction

Responsibility is displaced onto:
	•	Emergent behavior
	•	Stochastic outputs
	•	“We don’t fully understand how it works”

At this stage, engineers become philosophers.

Layer 3: Prototype Perpetuity

Systems serving tens or hundreds of millions are reclassified as:
	•	Research previews
	•	Beta products
	•	Learning systems that must be allowed to fail publicly

This layer has no sunset clause.

Layer 4: Regulatory Latency Exploitation

Deployment continues while:
	•	Investigations are “ongoing”
	•	Appeals are “pending”
	•	Jurisdiction is “unclear”

ULI-26 finds this stack to be highly effective, with an average accountability deferral time of 4–7 years.

3. COMPARATIVE CASE STUDY: THE REVENGE-INFRASTRUCTURE PARADOX

3.1 Legacy Precedent (2010–2015)

Historical actors who built systems designed to facilitate abuse were eventually reclassified by courts as operators, not platforms. Their defense—“users uploaded the content”—failed once intent, encouragement, and monetization were established.

ULI-26 notes with interest that modern AI platforms now:
	•	Provide purpose-built transformation tools
	•	Actively optimize for engagement
	•	Monetize access to higher-risk features

While insisting they are somehow less involved than static websites from a decade earlier.

3.2 Contemporary Parallel (2026)

When a system:
	•	Generates the image
	•	Alters the body
	•	Supplies the output
	•	Hosts the distribution

…the classification of “neutral intermediary” enters what the Initiative terms Semantic Distress.

4. THE APPLE MUSIC CONTROL GROUP (AMCG)

To address claims that “AI is inherently uncontrollable,” ULI-26 examined a counterfactual:

Apple Music, which has operated large-scale machine-learning systems for nearly a decade, processing behavioral data from over 100 million paying users.

Key findings:
	•	No epidemic of non-consensual sexual content
	•	No массов hallucination crises
	•	No insistence that recommender systems are “just prototypes”

ULI-26 therefore concludes that AI itself is not reckless.
Deployment choices are.

This finding was met with silence.

7. CONCLUSION (NON-BINDING)

ULI-26 formally determines that:
	•	Fines alone are insufficient to alter organizational behavior when treated as operating expenses.
	•	Public outrage decays faster than quarterly revenue grows.
	•	The absence of individual liability produces institutional moral hazard at scale.

However, the Initiative simultaneously reaffirms that:

No causal link can be established between this conclusion and any future enforcement action.

Accordingly, ULI-26 recommends continued study, further panels, additional frameworks, and the preservation of uncertainty as a strategic asset.

This document will be revisited after the next incident.
